        <h1>Here Are Each of Our Fine Gentlemen</h1>

        <div class="gentleman">
            <h2>1) Gethmika (Gay Gossip Gethmika - GGG)</h2>
            <p>Also known as gay gossip gethmika is the first member of the gentlemen of Alethea. He is known for his sharp n sneaky skills in eavesdropping and also being caught multiple times with a toolkit containing of lipstick. His most basic neccassity in life is lipstick and he loves it so much. Going on to his more detailed persona, he is one of the main masterminds in the class and also respected by the peasents of other classes. He can easily influence kids and youngesters into his conspiracies and theories. He stands at a Average height and has a normal frame. He is one of the main people the school would miss once hes gone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gentleman">
            <h2>2) Ayaz (MasterOogway)</h2>
            <p>Ayaz aka master oogway received this unique name for his wisdom and intelligent decision making. Being a silent person throughout life is not so silent with his boys. Because of his tactics he is easily able to crack people's intentions and psychology js by observation. He is also one of the main masterminds of the gentlemen and is unique in his own way. He is quite popular as being innocent and also being compared to a side character in a class above but we will not be speaking about that and change the subject. The school will miss him too once he's gone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gentleman">
            <h2>3) Younus (Packgod Jr)</h2>
            <p>Things start to take a different and more deep analogy from younus as he is one of the main in the entrance of the deep masterminds.
            Younus AKA Packgod Jr is quite popular for his roasting skills that do not make sense at all. He drops one or two funny roasts once a while and it is spoken among others with nostalgia.
            His most favourite dialogue as "Please broüôèüôèü•∫ü•∫ü•∫" had turned into a inside joke among the distinguished gentlemen. He is compared to other gentlemen loved more by most girls due to his thousand yard stare and his trending upperback incident with another masterminded gentleman, Saqeef (respect on to his name)
            Younus will be missed deeply and the school will moan once he leaves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gentleman">
            <h2>4) Saqeef (fitxdiddy)</h2>
            <p>oh man oh where do we even start, he was moving like leonardo di caprio in early 2025 and late 2024. Loved by many girls and even respected immensly by boys too. His main characteristic is being extremely goofy and very funny at times and also a philosphical side. EVEN NOW he is loved by EVERYONE. He is also respected alot by his other gentlemen for calling his frnds from out and threatening a fellow from senior class who tried to fight him w his frnds. Which turned horrible and that senior ended up crying from fear of possible harm. The school will miss Saqeef alot and everyone who prayed on his downfall shall be dealt with by nature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gentleman">
            <h2>5) Uzair (Packgod)</h2>
            <p>Hearing his name is enough for most people to feel fear. Proved himself by beating the shit out of many people. Still, Deepdown this gentleman is a great gentleman. No thoughts of overthrowing the gentlemen union and building his own and is very loyal to the top masterminds which is often complex to see in fellow gentlemen. He is called packgod due to his savage roast skils which might make u rethink why u decided to mess with him. Him having beef with another mastermind is a example for his top notch and independent decision and doesnt fear to speak up about betrayal. He is one of real ones of the mastermind union and an underrated character.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gentleman">
            <h2>6) Janek (Comedian)</h2>
            <p>Known to be one of the main in the foundation placed in these young and unique gentlemen. He is known for his ultimate comedy and being able to blend between humour and real talks. Laying the foundation was done by him and it was later devoloped very further by Saqeef. He is someone that is also in the top mastermind union and also respected.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gentleman">
            <h2>7) Hakam (Silent Killer 68)</h2>
            <p>One of the severely underestimated and underrated gentleman in this union. He is a very down to earth type gentleman and very close with two of the gentlemen in this union. Due to his smooth energy with everyone and blending real talks and punching me in the balls he is regarded tuff. The gentlemen union sees him as a very trustworthy source.</p>
